# Deploy SAP Build Apps to Work Zone

## Build your app for deployment

1.  You should already have your app open in SAP Build Apps from the previous exercise. If not, you can return to the Lobby to open the Bonus Barcode app. If you need assistance with this, refer to [Accessing your BTP trial account, subaccount, and the SAP Build Lobby](../lobbyaccess/)

2. Select the Launch tab

3. SAP Build Apps can build for mobile device deployment, or for Work Zone deployment. For this we will create a new build configuration. Select **Create Configuration**.

- Click **Build**

The new build will show up in your Build History with an indicator of the build progress.

## Deploy your app to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition

1. Once the build is complete, the status will change to **Delivered**. Click on the build name to access the build details.

3. This will open the Deploy to Work Zone dialog.

- Select the API endpoint of your trial account in the dropdown. It should be on CF-US10-xxx.

- After selecting the endpoint, you will need to select **Login with BTP**. This will launch a separate window to authenticate using your BTP credentials.

- Use the **Organization** dropdown to select your trial account organization (it will have trial in the name).

- Use the **Space** dropdown to select the **dev** space.

- Click **Continue**

5. The Deploy to Work Zone dialog will show you the build progress. Once it finishes, it will indicate that your app is live at the specified endpoint URL. If you try to access this URL in your web browser now, you will get an Access Denied error. We will address this in the next section. You can close this dialog and return to the SAP Build Lobby.
