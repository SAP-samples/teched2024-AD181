In this hands-on tutorial you will work through a set of exercises that highlight the capabilities of SAP Build Code with Joule AI copilot. Also showcased are the integration capabilities between SAP Build Code, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP’s Low-code/No-code development environment, SAP Build Apps. You will also (optionally) deploy your app into SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition with a SAP HANA Cloud database instance.

The business scenario for this exercise is focused on a points-based
customer loyalty programme with data related to Customers, Purchases and
Redemptions. Within the Purchases area we will integrate our product
data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Using SAP Build Code and the Joule AI
copilot you will create data entities and backend logic. You will then
use SAP Build Apps to create a UI application to consume the data. Finally, you will deploy
your app to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition.
