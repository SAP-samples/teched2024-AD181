# Tutorial Overview

In this hands-on tutorial you will work through a set of exercises that highlight the capabilities of SAP Build Code with Joule AI copilot. Also showcased are the integration capabilities between SAP Build Code, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP’s Low-code/No-code development environment, SAP Build Apps. You will also implement an approval workflow with SAP Build Process Automation, and deploy your app into SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition.

The business scenario for this exercise is focused on a points-based
customer loyalty programme with data related to Customers, Purchases and
Redemptions. Within the Purchases area we will integrate our product
data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Using SAP Build Code and the Joule AI
copilot you will create data entities and backend logic. You will then
use SAP Build Apps to create a UI application to consume the data, and an
approval workflow with SAP Build Process Automation. Finally, you will deploy
your app to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition.
