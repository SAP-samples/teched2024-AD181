4.  Select Go and navigate through each of the tiles
    (Customers, Purchases. Redemptions) in the Customer Loyal UI to see
    the generated data. Please note that in the application Preview not
    all functions may be available. Note that the A_ProductMaster entity may return no data, or a 404 error code. This should work correctly in the deployed application.
