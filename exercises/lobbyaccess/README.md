# Accessing your BTP trial account, subaccount, and the SAP Build Lobby

All of the tools in this tutorial are accessed through the SAP Build Lobby. You will access the Lobby through your BTP trial subaccount.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this tutorial, you have two identities configured: 
> - The identity used to register at SAP.com and create your trial subaccount (the default identity provider). You will use this identity to log into the SAP BTP Cockpit. 
> - The identity created for SAP Build Apps (the custom identity provider). You will use this identity to log into the SAP Build Lobby.

5. If you are't logged in with the custom identity provider, you may log out and log back in. When you log in, select your custom identity provider. Similarly, if you are asked to log into the Lobby, or any of the SAP Build tools launched from the lobby, be sure to select the custom identity provider.
