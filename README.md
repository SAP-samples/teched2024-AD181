# AD181 | Develop applications and processes with SAP Build and Joule

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2024 session [AD181 | Develop applications and processes with SAP Build and Joule](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/virtual/flow/sap/te24/catalog/page/catalog/session/1722394882270001djar).  

## Overview

In this hands-on tutorial you will work through a set of exercises that highlight the capabilities of **SAP Build Code** with **Joule AI copilot**. Also showcased are the integration capabilities between **SAP Build Code**, **SAP Build Apps**, and **SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition**. 

You will gain comprehensive knowledge of full-stack development, low-code development, and business site creation with SAP Build. Learn how the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is leveraged in a highly productive development environment with SAP Joule generative AI.

## Prerequisites

The environment is already setup and configured for you. The links are below.

This workshop should be run in a private (or incognito) browser to avoid login conflicts with other sessions or SAP accounts. 

The Google Chrome browser is recommended.

It is recommended that you clear your browser cache with **CTRL-SHIFT-DELETE** (PC) or **COMMAND-SHIFT-DELETE** (Mac).

## Logging In

You will be given a 3-digit user number at the start of the workshop. This number will be used for your unique user ID and password. Your instructor will share the format for the user ID and password. Note: you do not need to log into Github.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user name has a 4-digit user number (with a leading 0), and the password has a 3 digit number.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When saving application artifacts, please add your user number to the project name. For example, when creating the SAP Build Code project "customer_loyalty" be sure to give the project a unique name such as "customer_loyalty_xxx" (using your user number). This will help you quickly identify your project as there are many participants creating projects with the same name.
